        Questionate is an application developed by Ethan Dinh and Emil
        Melconian. Intended as a digital study tool, the goal during development
        was to create a simple and easy-to-use application that helps students
        memorize and learn efficiently. With two learning modes, students are
        able to use a template to input custom information, or use one of our
        offered study topics.

      <h1 className="abtus">About Our Journey</h1>
      <h4 className="abtus">
        We began working on Questionate only a few weeks ago. The entire process
        of app developing was new to us, but we did not let that stop us from
        using our knowledge of software development to take this opportunity to
        learn and try to create something new and useful. Using resources listed
        below, as well as learning the necessary Javascript, HTML, and CSS
        programming languages were not easy to do in such a short timeframe, but
        through time our app was in developing stages. We also became familiar
        with Javascript front-end library React, which helped us build this user
        interface. The entire process has been very beneficial to us. Learning
        new programming languages is one of many lessons we learned while
        working on this app, but by also using applications such as GitHub to
        store, manage, track, and control changes to our program, we are better
        prepared for our next steps in our omputer science career.
